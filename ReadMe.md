The purpose of this code is identify the length of sequence reads for 16s ribosomal RNA from 5 species of Thermoanaerobacter
This code will rename files downloaded from NCBI to include "Thermo" in the name and then print to an output file named ReadLengths.txt the species
name and the number of basepairs in the read. 

This code was run using Chinook cluster provided by the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

The code file "fastaprocess.bm" can be found at github.com/hlwoody/FastaProcess or in Chinook: /center1/hlwoody/FASTA

Files used in this code were obtained from NCBI, and should work with any .fasta file type. 
files I used can be found at /center1/hlwoody/FASTA
